## Introduction

This was my fourth homework assignment. It seems every week gets tougher and tougher. For this assignment, we generated a quiz that had many event listeners. For each question were four options to choose from. Once time elapsed, you were given a score and prompted to enter your initials that would be added to the highscores table. In order to complete the acceptance criteria, we must accomplish the following:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap (sigh)...is a beautiful asset. It's purpose is for easier styling. From its website, there are multiple preset styles from buttons, to forms, and even modals. I used bootstrap for my buttons and positioning of elements. I used the grid system to center my questions by setting the middle column to 8 while the left and right were 2.

## Functions and Setting Variables
 
This segment by far was the most challenging. I googled for days in search of a starting point. I figure I'd used some of the data I saw as a reference. Almost every variable must be called using jquery. Jquery esstentially takes the class or id and can convert it to a variable. Functions triggered when "clicks" or listeners became active. I used arrays to order the questions and multiple choices. I'm very familiar with indexes so I felt this was the best method for me to understand.


## Misc
  
Comments were added for clarity. I also added some spacing for legibility purposes. Initially I thought about creating an additional html file, but I was able to find resources that allowed me to not create a new file. Instead, I stuck to using just one.

## Lessons Learned

PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE & RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH. I spent well over 20 hours trying to get this homework squared away. I hit a ton of walls. I was trying to memorize what I had learned without realizing that Google was my friend. From now on, I plan on practicing with what I've learned more than ever. Also, I can't be afraid to use Google as a guide. There are many methods to generating a solution. I just have to choose the right one for me.
