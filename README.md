# Code-Quizzer

## Introduction

This was my fourth homework assignment. It seems every week gets tougher and tougher. For this assignment, we generated a quiz that had many event listeners. For each question were four options to choose from. Once time elapsed, you were given a score and prompted to enter your initials that would be added to the highscores table. In order to complete the acceptance criteria, we must accomplish the following:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap (sigh)...is a beautiful asset. It's purpose is for easier styling. From its website, there are multiple preset styles from buttons, to forms, and even modals. I used bootstrap for my buttons and positioning of elements. I used the grid system to center my questions.

## Functions
 
After

## Object

Once the user has answer the first alert, the user is then asked to choose what KIND (key value pairs) of characters they wish to use in the password. We use window.confirm to answer "Ok" which would be yes or true and "Cancel" which would be no or false. The if arugements that follow will concatenate the key value pairs if true. Once the passwordText has been concatenate, we must use randomization to choose the characters from the length of passwordText.

## Password

After each character is randomly selected, it becomes the new valvue of password. Password is then passed into the passwordText.value.

## Misc
  
Comments were added for clarity. I also added some spacing for legibility purposes.  

## Lessons Learned

I learned about the importance of understanding variables and queries. Every week, these assignments get more challenging. I was also taught a new method of determining how my code is functioning by using Debugging from the Sources in the DevTool. This allowed me to take my code step by step to understand what is being communicated in realtime.
